    <h2>1. History and Origin</h2>
    <p>Madhubani painting, also known as Mithila painting, is a traditional Indian art form from the Mithila region, which includes parts of Bihar, Jharkhand, and Nepal. It is believed to have been practiced for over 2,500 years. The art is thought to have originated during the time of the Ramayana, and is closely associated with Hindu mythology. King Janaka, father of Sita, is believed to have commissioned these paintings for Sita's wedding.</p>
 
    <h2>2. Characteristics of Madhubani Art</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Themes:</strong> Common themes include nature (trees, flowers, animals, birds), mythological and religious subjects (gods and goddesses), and social themes (weddings, daily life, fertility symbols).</li>
        <li><strong>Distinctive Features:</strong> Madhubani art is known for intricate line work, vibrant colors, and geometric patterns. The paintings often feature bold lines and bright colors like red, black, and yellow, with details in green, blue, and other shades.</li>
    </ul>
 
    <h2>3. Techniques and Tools</h2>
    <p>Traditional Madhubani artists use tools like twigs, fingers, and brushes to create the detailed patterns. The art is usually painted on surfaces such as walls, cloth, paper, and canvas. Artists make their own brushes for finer details and use natural pigments for colors.</p>
